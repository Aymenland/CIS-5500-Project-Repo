<h2>Project Description</h2>

If you liked a certain music and listened to it a bunch, Spotify will pick up on it and start recommending you similar pieces. If you liked a certain movie, Netflix will be sure to let you know of similar movies. But we rarely think of books the same way. We’re going to make a tool that allows you to search a database of hundreds of thousands of books, filter by genre and author and other parameters, and find books you’ll enjoy based on ones you already read.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>A search function to browse through the books database. It includes the following filters:
<ul>
<li>Book title</li>
<li>Author name</li>
<li>Year of publication</li>
<li>Average reviews upper-bound</li>
<li>Average reviews lower-bound</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A feature to select favorite books through the search feature.</li>
<li>ML-based recommendations based on the selected books.</li>
<li>A random fun fact that changes every page refresh, picked from a list, each being the result of an interesting query from the datasets.</li>
</ul>
